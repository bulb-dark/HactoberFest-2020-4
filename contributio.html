<header> Mistakes to avoid while contributing in hactober fest</header>
<ol>
<li> Avoid submitting low-quality pull requests such as automated changes to fix typos</li>
<li>Do not add your name to a README file or contribute to repositories created solely for Hacktoberfest that offer no real benefit to the open-source community.</li>
<li>Do not submit untested code or contributions that introduce new dependencies without a clear, justifiable reason, as maintainers are wary of potential security risks.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li> Happy hacking </li>
<li> Lots of love from Nepal</li>
</ul>
